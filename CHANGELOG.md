# 0.5.0
* **BREAKING** Global configuration will now be loaded from the users configuration directoy (for example `~/.config/wutag.yml`) and the file must not contain a `.` at the start of the filename.
* Add `update-registry` subcommand that scans for changes to the files tracked by wutag
* Add better handling of errors when a file has a maximum number of xattributes
* All output is now raw by default, to enable it use `-p` or `--pretty` global flag or set `pretty_output: true` in configuration
* Subcommands `set`, `rm` and `clear` now take a list of paths to process rather than a pattern by default. Previous behaviour was preserved with a flag `-g` or `--glob` to treat the first provided path as a glob pattern.
* Add `get` subcommand that lists tags of specified entries
* The `clear` subcommand is now split into multiple subcommands like `wutag clear tags <TAGS>...` or `wutag clear files <PATHS>...`

  WARNING! this version is completely different functionally from the older one and the tags have to be recreated
